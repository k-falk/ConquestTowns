API + Guidance

Changelog:
----------
1) Placing town chests now works with the new display name format <town> Vault.
2) Updated town broadcast message to format)  <Town> | <Player> // <msg>. If it's an announcment format will be  <Town> //.
3) Fixed admin commands not working.
4) Fixed console error when running /town upgrades <RANK> with an invalid rank string.
5) '/town upgrades <RANK>' now shows the quantity of required materials correctly.
6) Fixed a bug where towns could wage war on themselves
7) Formatted town rank string to only capitalise the first letter (neater formatting)
8) Town chest is correctly removed from a players inventory when they create a town
9) Changed border material to stone and add command for the owner to control it '/town border true/false'
10) Added pagination for help commands
11) Fixed a bug where towns would be active in a larger region even if they hadn't reached that rank yet, now this is fixed these 'unactivated' regions can
still be used/built upon by players as normal but no town chests can be placed in this area.
12) Fixed entry/exit message, this bug fix also follows directly from #11
13) Fixed a bug where players could accept an invite to another town/settlement without first leaving their town/settlement

FINAL note - I'd advise that we get the whole plugin working first, mainly the core functionality, then once we've tested and determined that war is working
as we want then we can look into player rewards and I can give you information on the API. The whole chest rewards and War still needs testing to ensure it's
 robust.

Changelog:
----------
1) Settlement joining not working -> I forgot to add the command (/settlement join <name>), all done now should be able to accept settlement invites
    1.b) Add command to leave settlement for players -> /settlement leave
    1.c) Success message now shown when sending an invitation

2) When you place the Create A Town chest it should change the name from Create A Town to like "<Town Name> Vault" -> DONE
3) Command asthetics, command system is not setup to handle that, would require a whole overhaul and a lot of additional work.
4) Town broadcast now has prefix of the town's name before any message
5) Are there admin commands? -> YES! (/towna) - see console for permissions, they get printed out upon startup
6) Interact permissions is now locked to ALL and cannot be changed
7) War initiation message is now global.
    7.b) Players are sent a message notifying them they are at war (if applicable) when they log on
8) When you create a town, it moves all your settlement members to the new town and removes the old settlement
9) War is over message is displayed globally, and should only show up once now.
10) Yes the town region only considers X and Z coordinates so is independant of height.
11) I'm not going to code the plugin to handle reloads, if you know what's good for you, you won't be doing that anyway :)
12) I don't think there is currently a difference between Default and Member so that's buggy. Can you clarify what's wrong? Default is meant to be for all
players not in the town, and members for all members. For instance you may want to allow members to build in your town, but not players who don't belong to
your town.
13) The region seems to be extending out around 200 blocks from where the radius ends of the actual town -> Yes, that is a preventive measure so other towns
can't be create which may overlap with your future upgrade space. So when the plugin calculates permissible distances between towns it checks the range is
greater than the MAX_SIZE + REGION_SPACING.
14) Permissions clarification -> All is basically EVERYONE, so everyone can do that action, members or not. Member is, well a town member. In the permissions
 system players can only perform actions if they have equal or greater than permission. For example if you have build set to Member, then non-members cannot
 build, but members, managers and owners can.
15) The obsidian border was more just a visual thing for me for testing, I can add commands to allow the owner to raise/lower the border if you'd like me to?
16) Players cannot manually place items in their vault so they won't be able to 'block it up'.
17) Entry/Exit messages are now shown to players when entering or leaving a town.
18) Added a configuration option to prevent players building in a certain radius from a town chest.
19) Town members are notified when a member from the town they are at war with enters their town.
20) Fixed error when executing "/town list" if there are no towns.
21) For "/town upgrade" if you don't have the required resources it tells you what you need, for "/town upgrades <RANK>" it tells you what resources are
needed to upgrade to that rank of town.


Questions:
----------
1) Scoreboards break your healthbar plugin, well yep! What do you want to do about this?
2) I thought you had a conquest type plugin to award players town's rewards when they were capturing a flag, or the like?
3) I don't understand what exactly you're asking for the town guest feature?
